# Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) Analysis


This repository was migrated to the [Data Science for Conservation Project](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Conservation/LocalLWCF). That project now holds the data, processing code, and source files for an article giving an overview of the LWCF, analyzing local grant spend by county, and reviewing the impact of LWCF grants in New England.
